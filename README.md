# Valorant-bypass
Valorant "Bypass" reverse engineered from Helpware. it's pretty fucking simple and idk why they didn't even release it to public lol

## idk?

i reverse engineered thier Valorant "bypass" for Triggerbot lol it was pretty simple and didn't have any obfuscation on it only pyinstaller but all public tools didn't support that version of python so i had to make my own tool to get it from .pyc but that was like 7 lines of code lol

also i upgraded that bypass and wrote it in c++ 

how to use it in c++?

make new project on VS add main.cpp as main file or just copy the fucking source code then compile it as x64 release when you get the exe use some packer like UPX or other shit and boom you have the bypass or you can just simply get it fully working version from releases on this repo (;

## Compilation (extra)

to compile it you will need jsoncpp lib so just get vcpkg and use this command to download it `vcpkg install jsoncpp`
